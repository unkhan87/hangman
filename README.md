# Hangman

Hangman is a guessing game and is usually played by two or more people, where one player thinks of a word while the other players guess what the word is by guessing one letter at a time until the whole word is revealed or they run out of tries.
The game is usually played with a Paper-and-pencil however I decided to create electronic version of the game that you can play against the computer rather than playing against another person.
I've used python programming language to program this game. Number of different functions have been created in order to achieve different tasks for this game.
